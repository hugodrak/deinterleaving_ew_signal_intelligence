Below is an example **Python** code structure for a *Deinterleaving-Analysis* project. It demonstrates how to read sample radar/communication pulses from a CSV, separate them into likely “emitters” or “tracks” based on pulse repetition intervals (PRIs) or other signal characteristics, and visualize the results.

# How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Command-line usage**:
   ```bash
   python src/deinterleave.py --input data/sample_signals.csv --method naive --threshold 0.02
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python src/deinterleave.py --input data/sample_signals.csv --method advanced
   ```
3. **Jupyter notebooks**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open `notebooks/deinterleaving_theory.ipynb` to read about the theory.
   - Open `notebooks/algorithm_demo.ipynb` to see a hands-on example of the code.

## Extending This Project

- **Advanced Clustering**: Replace the `simple_time_based_deinterleave` with more robust approaches (e.g., DBSCAN or HDBSCAN on [time, frequency], or more advanced pattern recognition).  
- **Machine Learning**: Use supervised or semi-supervised learning if you have labeled pulses from known emitters.  
- **Real-Time Streams**: Adapt the code to deinterleave pulses as they arrive, rather than from a static CSV file.  
- **Visualization**: Enhance plots with color-coded frequencies, interactive charts (Plotly, Dash, etc.).
